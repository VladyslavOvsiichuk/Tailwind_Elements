<p class="mb-2">Tailwind Elements does not change or add any CSS to the already one from TailwindCSS. </p>

<p class="mb-2">You can directly copy our components into your Tailwind design and they will work straight away.</p>

<p>In some dynamic components (like dropdowns or modals) we add Font Awesome icons and custom JavaScript. However, they do not require any additional installation, all the necessary code is always included in the example and copied to any Tailwind project - it will work.</p>
